Cream Puffs

Ingredients - Pastries
=======================
1 stick (8 Tbsp) unsalted butter 
1 tsp granulated sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup water
1 cup all purpose flour (loose, do not pack)
5 large eggs
1 Tbsp water
2 Tbsp powdered sugar

Ingredients - Cream 
===================
1 pint heavy whipping cream (chilled)
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions
==========
- Preheat oven to 375F
- Line large baking sheet with parchment paper
- Combine butter, salt, 1 tsp granulated sugar, and water in a sauce pan and bring to a boil over medium heat
- Add entire cup of flour and mix quickly and continue mixing until you see a film forming on the bottom of the pan
- Transfer the contents to a large bowl and allow to cool for 3-4 minutes
- While cooling wisk together one egg and 1 Tbsp water to make an egg wash and set aside
- Add 4 eggs, one at a time, to the dough, stirring each in thoroughly before adding the next. 
- After the last egg is stirred in, continue stirring for about 1 minute
- Spoon dough into 2 inch rounds on the pan (you should get 10 total), use a finger dipped in water to ensure the tops are round with no peaks.
- Brush the egg wash over the top of each pastry
- Bake puffs until they are golden brown and dry on top, about 30-35 minutes. Minimize how often you open the door of the oven and make sure they are good and golden before you remove from the oven, otherwise they will collapse
- Transfer puffs to cooling racks and allow to cool to room temp

- Combine heavy cream, 1/4 granulated sugar and vanilla extract in a bowl
- Using a mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the mixture on a medium speed setting until it forms a thick whipped cream (can take 5 minutes or more)
- Cut puffs in half and spoon whipped cream into the air gap (or put the whipped cream in a piping bag and use that to spread it in the air gap).
- Replace top of puff and sprinkle powdered sugar across the top
