Ingredients
=======================
Dough
-----
1 cup whole milk
1 Tbsp granulated sugar divided
1 Tbsp Active dry yeast
2 large eggs room temperature
6 Tbsp unsalted butter (melted)
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp salt (Sea salt if possible)
4 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

Filling
-------
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
3 Tbsp ground cinnamon
5 Tbsp unsalted butter (melted)

Frosting
--------
8 oz cream cheese (softened)
4 Tbsp unsalted butter (softened)
1 cup powdered sugar
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract


Directions
=======================
1. Heat milk to 105 degrees (Microwave time about 50 seconds for 1000W microwave)
2. Stir in yeast and Tbsp of granulated sugar, allow to sit 5 minutes or until foamy
3. Pour mixture into stand mixer bowl. Add eggs, melted butter, vanilla extract and 1/2 cup granulated sugar 
4. Mix with dough hook until well mixed
5. Add cinnamon, salt, and flour and mix with dough hook on medium-low setting (2 or 3 on a Kitchenaid mixer)
6. Continue kneading with mixer until the mix forms a large ball on the hook and the bowl is mostly clear 
**** NOTE: The ball should only be lightly tacky. If it's still sticky after 10 minutes of kneading, add another 1/8-1/4 cup of flour.
7. Remove dough and knead by hand for another 3 minutes on a lightly floured surface
8. Spray the inside of a large bowl with non-stick spray and place dough ball in the bowl.
9. Cover bowl with a warm damp towel and allow to dough to rise in a warm place for 60 minutes.

10. While dough is rising you can mix the dark brown sugar and cinnamon for the filling and set it aside in a bowl
11. Once dough has risen, remove from the bowl and place on lightly floured surface
12. Using your hands and a rolling pin, work the dough into a 12x24 inch rectangle (Size is important here)
13. Melt the 5 Tbsp of butter and spread on the dough working it to all edges except leaving about 3/4" on the long edge farthest from you dry
14. Spread the cinnomon and brown sugar mix across the butter, leavin the last 3/4" band bare
15. Pat the mixture into the melted butter to ensure it's dampened and covers the dough completely (except for the 3/4" band)
16. Starting with the long edge closest to you, rollup the dough so you end up with a 24" long roll 
17. Cut through the roll at 2" intervals. You should end up with 12, 2" inch wide rolls

18. Line a metal 13x9 pan with parchment paper
19. Place the 12 rolls in the pan so the swirl shows. Equally space them, placing the outter most rolls up against the sides of the pan
20. Cover the pan with a warm damp towel and allow the rolls to rise for another 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
21. After the rolls have risen again, remove the towel and transfer them to the oven. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until lightly browned on top.

22. While the rolls are baking, beat the cream cheese, softened butter, and vanilla extract in a bowl
23. Continue beating while slowly adding the powdered sugar
24. Set aside while you wait for the rolls to finish (DO NOT REFRIGERATE)
25. When rolls are done, remove from oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes
26. Spread the frosting over the tops of the rolls while they're still somewhat warm
