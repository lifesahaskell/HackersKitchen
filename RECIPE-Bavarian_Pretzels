Bavarian Pretzels

Ingredients
=======================
1 Cup warm water (110 Degrees F)
1 Package of active dry yeast (7g/2.25 tsp)
1 Tbsp granulated sugar
3 Tbsp unsalted butter (melted and cooled)
3 1/4 Cups of all purpose flour
1 Tsp salt
8 Cups water
1/3 Cup baking soda
1 Tbsp dark brown sugar
1 Large egg
1 Tbsp water
1/4 Cup course ground salt for topping pretzels

Directions
==========
- Mix warm water, yeast, and sugar in a measuring cup and let stand 5-7 minutes until foamy on top
- Pour yeast mix into stand mixer bowl
- Add melted butter and flour to mixer bowl
- Using a dough hook, mix on low or medium low setting (1 or 2 on KitchenAid) until dough forms a smooth ball that is not tacky (can take 10 minutes or more)
- Liberally coat the inside of a glass bowl with vegetable oil, form dough into a ball and place in the bowl, moving it around to coat it in oil 
- Cover bowl with a clean towel and place in a warm location (or inside the microwave) to rise for about an hour

- Preheat oven to 450 Degrees F
- Pour mix 8 cups of water, baking soda, and brown sugar in a small stock pot and bring to a boil
- Cover large baking sheet with parchment paper and coat parchment paper with vegetable oil
- Remove dough from bowl and divide into 6 equal parts
- Coat hands with vegetable oil and roll each piece of dough into a 24" rope and shape the rope like an oval, cross the ends and fold over into a knot shape, placing on the baking sheet
- Take baking sheet to the stove top and one at a time cook the pretzel in the boiling water for 60 seconds, turning over halfway through. Dry each on a paper towel before placing back on baking sheet
- Separate egg yolk and mix yolk with tbsp of water to form an egg wash
- Brush egg wash over each pretzel and sprinkle with course salt
- Place pretzels in oven for 7 minutes
- Turn baking around and bake for another 7 minutes (this ensures even cooking)
- Remove from oven, allow to cool on a cooling rack
