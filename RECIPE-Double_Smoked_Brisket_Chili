INSTRUCTIONS
===================
1. Pour olive oil into a minimum 4qt Sauce Pan. Heat over medium heat.

7. Add broth, diced tomatoes with juice, rinsed beans, and tomato sauce and stir well
8. Transfer chili from saucepan to a 13x9 aluminum pan. 
9. Place chili on smoker and smoke at 225-250 degrees for 2.5 hours or until temp in the middle reaches 200
10. Spread shredded cheddar over the top of the chili and smoke for an additional 45 minutes 
11. Remove from smoker, let stand for 10 minutes, then serve.

OPTIONAL: Garnish with sour cream and green onion slices.

NOTE: Use your wood of choice for the smoker, I like a combination of Apple Wood and Red Oak. Also after adding the cheese, I usually add a new log to make sure I've got good smoke into the cheese. "Clean smoke" rules apply as always though, don't over do it with white billowy smoke. Make sure it's still good clean smoke throughout.
